    <h1>Welcome to Launcher</h1>
    <p>This app was created as a way for us to share our experiences in interviewing in the tech space. Interviews are hard
    and it's even harder when you don't know what you're being judged on. If I can help launch your career by giving you the 411
      on my interview experience, then I'm all about that (and I hope you are, too). So please share your experiences, and be honest. Share both
    the happy and sad paths, please. We can all learn from your experiences.</p>
