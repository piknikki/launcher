Problem: interviewing sucks. It's worse when you have no idea how to do well in interviews, and _even worse_ when 
an employer gives you feedback on a technical challenge (which you bombed) that wasn't in the specs. Luckily, we can help each other out. By 
entering your experiences here, you can help others and also benefit from the knowledge that others share. We help each other 
launch our careers. Plus, it's good for your karma and shit.
